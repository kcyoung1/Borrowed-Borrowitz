      "content": "<p>In a sign of voters&#39; shifting perspectives about Presidential hopefuls, a new survey reveals that Americans are deeply nostalgic for a Republican candidate who only wanted to screw over forty-seven per cent of them.</p><p>In interviews conducted across the country, voters expressed wistfulness and even a deep longing for a man who was indifferent to the fates of nearly half the nation&#39;s residents.</p><p>&ldquo;When he was running, it seemed like a bad thing that he didn&#39;t care whether forty-seven per cent of the country lived or died,&rdquo; said Tracy Klugian, of Akron, Ohio. &ldquo;Now I realize we were being too picky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He threw thousands of people out of their jobs and onto the streets, but he let them stay in the country,&rdquo; said Kent Bantwell, of Springfield, Missouri. &ldquo;I&#39;ve got to say, I miss him.&rdquo;</p><p>Harland Dorrinson, of Jupiter, Florida, said that he wished that the man would jump into the 2016 race, but admitted that was unlikely. &ldquo;That secret tape where he said he was screwing over forty-seven per cent of the country would be brought up again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The fact that he wasn&#39;t screwing over a bigger number would come back to haunt him now.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol Foyler, of San Dimas, California, said she wished she could take back &ldquo;all the nasty things&rdquo; she said about the man when he ran for President in 2012. &ldquo;I called him a jerk and a tool and a sociopathâ€”and worse,&rdquo; she remembered, shaking her head. &ldquo;Now he seems like Mandela.&rdquo;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Conspiracy theorists believe that the Republican Party did not die from natural causes but was instead the target of an elaborately planned killing, a leading conspiracy theorist has confirmed.</p><p>Harland Dorrinson, whose basement walls are covered with photos of suspects in the killing of the G.O.P., has spent countless hours connecting those photos with different colors of yarn in the hopes that a larger pattern would emerge.</p><p>&ldquo;Because the Republican Party is one hundred and sixty-one years old, it&#39;s assumed that it was time for it to die,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The truth is, that&#39;s exactly what the people who killed it want us to think.&rdquo;</p><p>While some conspiracy theorists have focussed on the billionaire Donald J. Trump as the most likely suspect in the death of the Republican Party, Dorrinson favors a &ldquo;two-killer&rdquo; theory that involves Arizona Senator John McCain and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.</p><p>&ldquo;McCain tapped Palin to be his running mate, and that led directly to people like Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, and Donald Trump being considered credible candidates,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no logical reason why McCain would have chosen Palin unless he wanted to kill the Republican Party.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to the McCain-Palin cabal, Dorrinson is considering a host of other suspects, including the industrialists David and Charles Koch, the Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, and the novelist Ayn Rand.</p><p>&ldquo;The only suspect I have definitively ruled out is Mitch McConnell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#39;t imagine a scenario where he accomplished something.&rdquo;</p>",

Are you going to be able to make it through this?&rsquo; &rdquo; Dorrinson said. &ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;I&#39;ll be fine. Ben Carson is starting to talk now; that&#39;ll be soothing.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>But, moments later, when New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, falsely claimed that he never supported the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Slessky experienced acute dizziness and blurry vision, and was immediately rushed to the hospital.</p><p>HonestyWatch&#39;s Dorrinson said it was unlikely that he would ask Slessky or any of his other fact checkers to work future Republican debates. &ldquo;I care about these people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Many of them have families.&rdquo;</p><p>Speaking from his hospital bed on Friday, Slessky still seemed blindsided by his sudden disintegration. &ldquo;Going into the debate, I actually believed that the volume of falsehoods was going to be more manageable this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought Carly Fiorina not being there would help.&rdquo;</p>",
